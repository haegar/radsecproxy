radsecproxy (1.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  To improve the overall security of the system, radsecproxy is now running
  with reduced privileges and as a dedicated system user "radsecproxy" instead
  of running as root.
  
  This may require configuration changes in order for radsecproxy to be able
  to continue accessing its configuration file and configured certificates and
  private keys, as well as to be able to write to potentially configured log
  file destinations.
